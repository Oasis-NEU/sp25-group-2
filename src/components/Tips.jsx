                -Bring copies of your resume
                -Review your resume to know key details about previous jobs, internships, personal projects, etc
                -Be confident: Sit up straight, maintain eye contact, smile
                -Showcase soft skills: Be ready to discuss soft skills like communication, teamwork, and adaptability. Provide specific examples that illustrate these abilities in action.
                -Practice mock interviews: Run mock interviews with friends or career advisors to refine your answers and receive constructive feedback on your presentation style. 
                -Think of questions: make a list of thoughtful questions about the company and job description. Asking these questions will help you decide if the internship meets your needs and shows that you’re genuinely interested in the position.
